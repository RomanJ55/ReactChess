# Chess Game with React as the frontend and Python in the backend

Using my own Python-Chess game project as the backend

- https://github.com/RomanJ55/Chess-Game

Added Flask and gunicorn for the server/api

- backend repo: https://github.com/RomanJ55/backend (hosted on heroku)

Fully functional chess game following the standard chess rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess

- Time is set to 15 Minutes by default

Not working/bugs:

- en passant moves https://support.chess.com/article/683-what-is-en-passant
  (I didn't know they existed...)

- Timers reset when the user reloads the page
